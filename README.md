# Atlas Global Gayrimenkul - Modern Emlak Çözümleri

## Project Overview
Atlas Global Gayrimenkul is a web-based platform aimed at providing professional real estate services, including property buying, selling, renting, and investment consultancy. This project utilizes modern web technologies to deliver a user-friendly interface and quick access to real estate services in Ankara, with a specific focus on the Yenimahalle area.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd atlas-global-gayrimenkul
   ```

3. **Open the HTML files in a browser:**
   Simply open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to view the site.

*Note: The project uses external CSS and JS libraries served from CDN, so there's no need for local setup of these dependencies.*

## Usage
Simply launch any of the provided HTML files in your web browser. The main file to view is `index.html`, which serves as the homepage. Navigate through the links to access services like:
- **Property Buying and Selling** (`alim-satim.html`)
- **Property Rental** (`kiralama.html`)
- **Investment Consultancy** (`yatirim.html`)
- **Property Evaluation** (`expertiz.html`)

## Features
- Responsive design with modern layout using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- Multi-page structure for various services offered.
- Contact information and call-to-action buttons to engage with the service provider directly.
- Professional styling and well-structured content tailored for real estate services.

## Dependencies
This project utilizes the following dependencies:
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first CSS styling.
- **Font Awesome** for icons.

These libraries are included via CDN, so no installation is necessary beyond a working internet connection for assets to load.

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

```
